        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        Two of my favorite hobbies are video games and reading. For video games I enjoy an assortment of genres. To list a few genres:
        <ul>
            <li>Strategy</li>
            <li>RPG</li>
            <li>FPS</li>
            <li>MMO's</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I tend to jump between very competitive games and very relaxing games. I would say it just depends on the mood I am in. For reading I enjoy genres like fantasy, mystery, horror, and the odd romance. A recent author I have been reading more of is Stephen King. </p>
