        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I joined this program to attain the skills and tools to have a career in these fields. I am a big fan of electronics and art so I saw this as a good opportunity for me. I am the kind of person who enjoys going out and adventuring, gettting out in nature and playing sports. On the other hand I also enjoy just laying in bed and being lazy way too much.</p>
        <p>Ive grown up around Canada and Ottawa is by far the furthest east I've been. I look forward to seeing the east coast and experiencing everything my country has to show. I want to get a cat to have as a cuddle bug and lap warmer as we get into the winter season.</p>

        <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        Two of my favorite hobbies are video games and reading. For video games I enjoy an assortment of genres. To list a few genres:
        <ul>
            <li>Strategy</li>
            <li>RPG</li>
            <li>FPS</li>
            <li>MMO's</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I tend to jump between very competitive games and very relaxing games. I would say it just depends on the mood I am in. For reading I enjoy genres like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fantasy</li>
                <li>Mystery</li>
                <li>Horror</li>
                <li>Romance</li>
            </ul>
           <p>A recent author I have been reading more of is Stephen King. </p>
