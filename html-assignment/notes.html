    <h1>Here are some HTML tags I have learned</h1>
    <p>If I want to give something emphasis I like to use the tag <strong>Strong</strong> or <em>emphasis</em>.</p>
    <p>If I were to use a chemical formula I would use subtext like H<sub>2</sub>O or if I was doing math and I would need to use supertext such as 10<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p>I also learned how to highlight text using <mark>marker</mark>.</p>
